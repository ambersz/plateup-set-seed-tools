							Low: (Lean no split slightly) Verifiers' additional work is mostly

							Medium: (Lean no split more) lots of new runs to fill in empty
							leaderboards will be submitted even if they were slower than a WR
							by the same runner/group on the older, slower version-- high load
							for verifiers, but not for runners (because incentive to re-run
							old categories is just more fun!)

							High: (Lean no split strongly) lots of new runs to fill in empty

							For context, as of 1.1.9 PlateUp had 434 runnable categories
							(accounting for player and set seed restrictions on some map
							settings) and now, 12 months since the 1.1.7 board split, about a
							quarter of the leaderboards are still empty.
							<br /> Due to the introduction of Tacos, 1.2.0 PlateUp has added
							31 new categories for Tacos as a starting dish for a total of 465
							categories. A board split would mean introducing 465 completely
							empty leaderboards. (Actually potentially 570, pending certain mod
							approvals)
							<br />
							Probably doesn't make sense to directly compare version-based
							board splits on other games to this potential board split because
							the number of unique leaderboards we have is so large.

							The placement number: (Lean split) The lower the placement, the
							less relevant the run. Splitting leaderboards will prevent people
							from submitting runs that beat pre-split runs, therefore their
							placements are protected. Achievements and recognition of hard

							Visibility of records: (Lean no split) Because old records are not
							in the default view, they will tend only to be seen by people who
							are specifically looking for old records as opposed to anyone
							checking the leaderboard, and that makes pre-split records feel
							less valuable/appreciated.

						<td>
							Competition: (Lean no split) A submitted time feels valuable
							because of the context of runs you are faster/slower than; or
							because people can <i>try</i> to beat your time, but they haven't
							succeeded (yet). Splitting the board means no one can even try to
							beat your pre-split times; the loss of that competition makes
							existing pre-split records and new submissions feel less valuable
							because they're on separate leaderboards and cannot be compared
							against each other (vs. no split, where you have the ability to
							view only runs on a specific version range using SRC filter
							controls)
